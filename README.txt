List of files supporting MSCIDCmain.m (main file) are:
1) levy.m contains levy distribution
2) uavdynamicsvelocity.m contains UAV dynamics
3) ellipseang.m computes the initial angular position for divide and conquer mitigation
4) refpoint.m computes the reference point if the point crosses the swarm boundary
5) searchopp.m computes the reference points for search in opposite direction of maximum information

How to execute:
1) Use matlab version mentioned above as this software is tested
2) Copy all the six matlab files into single folder
